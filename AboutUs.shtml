			<h3>The Women in Science and Engineering Theme Program began in 1999 as a place for women to explore their interest in math, science, and engineering alongside peers. A live-in Theme Program Assistant provides resources and support for residents' social and academic needs. Our academic seminar includes learning from faculty and peers, mixed with career advising tailored to math, science, and engineering work. Continuing WiSE students can become mentors for new residents. Residents participate in socials, community outreach and activities, and have meaningful interaction with faculty and staff. WiSE students have fun, grow as women and as leaders, and form friendships that can last a lifetime.</h3>

			<h2>Program Requirements</h2>
			<h3>WiSE residents are expected to spend 2-4 hours a week engaged in Theme Program activities including:

			- Enrollment in at least 2 math, science, or engineering classes each semester
			- Enrollment and active participation in the MCB 98 fall and spring WiSE seminar (Fall 2011: Mondays, 6-7:30pm)-->
			- Attendance at WiSE meetings
			- Participation in Theme Program events, community service activities, and the mentor program</h3>

			<h2>Living Space</h2>
			<h3>WiSE residents live together in Foothill, in the Hillside complex, which is situated in the beautiful Berkeley hills on the northeast end of campus. Itâ€™s about a 15-minute walk from the center of campus, and there is a free nearby shuttle service to drive you around campus.

			You can take a virtual tour of sample furnished suites in Foothill (click on the links in the right column). Each room has in-room network connections and basic cable, and Foothill has laundry facilities, vending machines, and live-in staff. Most students have a roommate, and eat meals in the Foothill Dining Commons. Residents have access to a great Academic Services Center in Foothill, which offers tutoring, peer advising, copy and fax services, and computers and printers.</h3>
